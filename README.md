DownloadsManager
A basic Python script to listen to the Download's directory for changes and auto-sort files into folders based on file type.
This script is a practice test for python scripting.


Getting Started

2. Specify the file types to listen and sort to.
3. Run python script from the terminal (terminal will remain open while script is running.
4. Enjoy

Python3+ needs to be installed on your local machine.



Additional Tips:
Formatting:
Use markdown to format your README. Markdown is easy to read and widely supported on GitHub.

In this image, change the 'source_dir' varibale to the folder that you want the script to listen to.
The other 'destination_dir_###' should be defined to located the folders that files need be move to.

In the if-else conditional statement, define the file extensions which you want the script to look out for and
set the 'dest' variable to the approapirate destination you wish the specific file be moved to.

## A method to have the script running at startup has not been decided on yet and instructions will be uploaded here once I've figured that out :D

PLEASE NOTE: This is an introductory test for Python automation scripting which I used as a learning opportunity. I also used certain YouTube guides and library documentaion to construct
and write this code.
